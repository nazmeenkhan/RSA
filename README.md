# RSA Description
RSA [secure data transfer technique]. The acronym RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, 
who first publicly described the algorithm in 1978.
# Project Description
 This Project is a chat application which transfers data after encrypting or securing it using RSA and Digital Signature algorithm
 Project involves 3 sections 
1- Encryption Decryption using RSA
2- Digital Signature
3- Both
# Requirement
Python IDE to run the code ex:IDLE
# Running the code
The above repository includes 3 files nserver.py, ucl.py and rsa.py
nserver is a server file, ucl is a client file and rsa is just an interfacing file between RSA module and server+client files

# Steps:
1-run the nserver.py either on cmd (if path variable has been set) or on IDLE
2-open another cmd to run ucl.py similar to nserver.py
3-Input the required data to get the output
